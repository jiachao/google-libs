# Google Libs

I ported [Typhoon Blade](https://github.com/chen3feng/typhoon-blade), a convenient software building tool designed for Linux, to Mac OS X.  

Authors of Typhoon Blade also released a [collection](https://github.com/chen3feng/thirdparty/) of open source packages prebuilt by Blade and named the collection `thirdparty`.

This project is a subset of the `thirdparty` collection but prebuilt for Mac OS X.  This subset currently includes `gflags`, `glog`, `googlepertools` and `gtest`.

So you can use this project together with [Typhoon Blade for Mac OS X](https://github.com/wangkuiyi/typhoon-blade) to build your software.
